# Lecture Website

#### By Olivia Hinton | Date: May 26, 2016

## Project Guidelines

* Create a new project called boring-lecture.html that is a fake page about a boring subject of your choice. Use lorem ipsum text to fill up the page using <p> tags.
* Create a section of the page at the beginning for an introduction to the lecture; in that intro, include a <h2> subheading, a paragraph or two, and a picture. Give each of these elements the class intro.
* Create CSS rules for h2.intro, p.intro, and img.intro. Remember that in CSS, classes are prefaced with a .
* Rewrite the boring-lecture page and remove the intro class from the elements themselves, and create a <div> with the intro class to hold the elements.
